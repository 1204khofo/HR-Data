### Project Overview:
---
This analysis explores the factors contributing to employee attrition within an organization by examining a dataset that includes demographic information, job-related attributes, and measures of job satisfaction. The primary objectives are to identify trends and patterns linked to attrition, assess the impact of job satisfaction, compensation, and career advancement on employees' decisions to leave, and create a predictive model to anticipate attrition. The insights gained from this analysis will facilitate data-driven decision-making for employee retention, ultimately assisting the organization in reducing turnover costs and fostering a more dedicated workforce. Additionally, we will uncover the dynamics that lead to employee attrition, which will enable the organization to enhance retention strategies.


### Data Sources 
---
The main data source utilized in this analysis is a HR.Data.csv file, an open-source dataset that can be freely downloaded from various online platforms.

### Tools Used
---
- Power BI
   - for Data Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization 
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations 
---
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and Preparations, we perform the following actions;
 ####1. Data loading and Inspection:
    - The dataset was imported from excel into PowerBI 
####2. Handling missing Variables:
    - Promoted headers; this means the first row of the data was used as column hearders
####3. Data Cleaning and Formatting:
    - Creation of new column:
       1. Created a conditional column to classify age brackets (Age_Band)
       2. Created a conditional column for Job Satisfaction Ratings

####4. Sort a Visual:
        - Created a conditional column to sort Column (Age_Band); Age_band was sorted by the new column created so that it will be arranged in ascending order in the visuals 


### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involves exploring of the data to answer some questions about the Data such as;
 - What is the overall Attrition Percentage
 - Which department have the highest attrition rate  
 - What is the Attrition count by Educational Field 

### Data Analysis 
---
This is where we include basic insights gained during analysis
 - The total number of employees is 1470
 - Total number of current employees is 1233
 - Total number of attritions is 237
 - Attrition rate is 16%
